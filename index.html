             <p><br><br>Cats are pets which tear your chairs,curtins,shoes and clothes.
                 They may eat your fish or break your cups,but they will always be your cute,annoying pets.There’s no question that cats are a popular choice for pets — in fact, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association, about 25 percent of U.S. households have these cute, furry felines as a live-in friend. Sure, they're mischievous at times, and they might love to lay across your keyboard while you're working or enjoy smacking things off your desk for no particular reason, but if you ask us, that's entirely part of their charm — and a big reason why we love them so much.

Not only are they adorable (because seriously, they're so cute), they're also fiercely independent, curious, and loyal — and can make amazing lifelong companions for you or your family. Here are 15 reasons why cats make the absolute best pets. (P.S. If you're thinking of adopting a new kitty, be sure to check out our list of the cutest cat names).
